<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Camera Module Insulating Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>UV Curable Type</li><li>Non-Curable Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Camera module insulating adhesives market consists of UV curable and non-curable types. UV curable adhesives are instantly cured when exposed to ultraviolet light, providing fast bonding for high-speed manufacturing processes. Non-curable adhesives do not require any special curing process and maintain their bonding strength over time without the need for additional curing. Both types offer strong adhesion properties for securing components within camera modules, but UV curable adhesives are favored for their quick curing capabilities in fast-paced manufacturing environments.</p></p>
