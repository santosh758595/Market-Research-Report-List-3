<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inorganic Waterproof Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid</li><li>Dry</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inorganic waterproof coatings are divided into two main types: liquid and dry. Liquid coatings are applied as a wet solution and then allowed to dry and cure, forming a protective barrier against water. Dry coatings, also known as powder coatings, are applied as a dry powder and then heated to form a solid film. Both types of coatings offer excellent waterproofing properties and are commonly used in various industries such as construction, automotive, and electronics for corrosion protection and moisture resistance.</p></p>
