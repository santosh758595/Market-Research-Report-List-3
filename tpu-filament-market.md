<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TPU Filament Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polyester-based TPU</li><li>Polyether-based TPU</li></ul></p>
<p><p>TPU filament is a popular material used in 3D printing due to its flexibility and durability. There are two main types of TPU filament based on their chemical composition: polyester-based TPU and polyether-based TPU. Polyester-based TPU filaments are known for their high resistance to oils, chemicals, and abrasion, making them suitable for industrial applications. Polyether-based TPU filaments, on the other hand, are more elastic and tear-resistant, making them ideal for applications that require flexibility and stretchability. Both types offer unique properties and advantages in various printing projects.</p></p>
