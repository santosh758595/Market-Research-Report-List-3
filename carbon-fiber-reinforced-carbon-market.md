<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Carbon Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical Vapor Deposition</li><li>Liquid Impregnation Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon fiber-reinforced carbon (CFRC) material is commonly produced through two main processes: Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) and Liquid Impregnation Process (LIP). CVD involves depositing carbon atoms onto a substrate in a gaseous state, resulting in a high-strength CFRC material. LIP, on the other hand, involves soaking porous carbon preforms in a liquid carbon precursor, followed by carbonization to create CFRC. Both processes result in strong, lightweight materials suitable for high-performance applications in aerospace, automotive, and other industries.</p></p>
