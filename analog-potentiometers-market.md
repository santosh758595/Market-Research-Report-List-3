<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Analog Potentiometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Through Hole Type</li><li>SMD Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Analog potentiometers are divided into two main types: through hole type and SMD type. Through hole potentiometers are mounted onto circuit boards by inserting their leads through holes in the board and soldering them in place. SMD potentiometers, on the other hand, are surface-mounted components that are soldered directly onto the surface of the circuit board. Each type has its own advantages and applications, with through hole type being more durable and SMD type being more space-saving and suitable for compact electronic devices.</p></p>
