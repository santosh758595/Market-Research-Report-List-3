<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The I-line Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Photopolymerization</li><li>Light Decomposition Type</li><li>Photocrosslinked</li></ul></p>
<p><p>I-line photoresist is a crucial component in the semiconductor manufacturing process, primarily used in photolithography. There are three main types of I-line photoresist: photopolymerization, light decomposition type, and photocrosslinked. Photopolymerization photoresists rely on UV light to initiate a chemical reaction that hardens the material. Light decomposition types utilize UV light to break down certain molecules within the photoresist, creating a pattern. Lastly, photocrosslinked photoresists form a crosslinked network when exposed to UV light, making the material more stable and resistant to chemical etching.</p></p>
