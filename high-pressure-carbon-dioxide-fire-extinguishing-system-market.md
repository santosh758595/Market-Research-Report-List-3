<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Pressure Carbon Dioxide Fire Extinguishing System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unit Independent Fire Extinguishing System</li><li>Combined Distribution Fire Extinguishing System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Unit Independent Fire Extinguishing System is a type of high-pressure carbon dioxide fire extinguishing system where each protected area has its own independent storage of carbon dioxide for firefighting. This system is more flexible and cost-effective as it does not require a centralized storage unit.</p><p>On the other hand, Combined Distribution Fire Extinguishing System is a system where multiple protected areas are connected to a central storage unit of carbon dioxide. This system is more suitable for large buildings or facilities with multiple fire hazard areas, as it provides centralized control and distribution of the extinguishing agent.</p></p>
