<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiovascular Microcatheter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Lumen</li><li>Dual Lumen</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiovascular microcatheters are used for various procedures such as angiography and angioplasty. These catheters come in two main types: single lumen and dual lumen. Single lumen microcatheters have a single tube for delivering contrast agents or devices like stents, while dual lumen microcatheters have two separate lumens for simultaneous injection and aspiration. Single lumen catheters are typically used for simpler procedures, while dual lumen catheters are used for more complex interventions that require both injection and suction capabilities.</p></p>
