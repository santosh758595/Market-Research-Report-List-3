<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Protein Firefighting Foam Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fluoroprotein Foam</li><li>Protein Foam</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Protein firefighting foam is divided into two main types: Fluoroprotein Foam and Protein Foam. Fluoroprotein Foam is a type of foam that contains a fluorinated surfactant, which enhances its ability to create a stable and heat-resistant foam blanket. Protein Foam, on the other hand, is made from natural proteins such as animal tallow or vegetable oil, which allow it to create a thick and durable foam. Both types of foam are commonly used in firefighting operations to suppress and extinguish fires.</p></p>
