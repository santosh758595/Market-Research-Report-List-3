<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The X-ray FPD Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>X-ray FPD (Flat Panel Detector) market is divided into two main types: Indirect Conversion and Direct Conversion. Indirect Conversion FPDs use scintillators to convert X-rays into visible light, which is then converted into an electrical signal by a photodiode or CCD. Direct Conversion FPDs, on the other hand, directly convert X-rays into electrical signals using a semiconductor material like amorphous selenium. Indirect conversion systems tend to have higher image quality and lower noise levels, while direct conversion systems offer better efficiency and potentially lower radiation dose.</p></p>
