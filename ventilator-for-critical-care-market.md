<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ventilator for Critical Care Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Invasive ventilators are designed for patients who require assistance with breathing through the insertion of a tube into the airway. This type of ventilator is commonly used in intensive care units for patients with serious respiratory issues. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, provide breathing support without the need for intubation. These devices are often used for patients with less severe respiratory problems or for those who cannot tolerate invasive ventilation. Both types of ventilators play a crucial role in critical care settings to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation for patients.</p></p>
