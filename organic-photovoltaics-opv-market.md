<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Organic Photovoltaics (OPV) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PN Junction Structure (P-N Heterojunction)</li><li>Dye-sensitized Nanocrystalline Solar Cells (DSSC)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Organic Photovoltaics (OPV) can be classified into two main types based on their structure: P-N Junction Structure and Dye-sensitized Nanocrystalline Solar Cells (DSSC). P-N Junction Structure refers to the traditional semiconductor structure where a P-type material and N-type material are combined to form a heterojunction, allowing for efficient charge separation. On the other hand, DSSC utilizes a dye-sensitized layer of nanocrystalline titanium dioxide to capture sunlight and convert it into electricity, making it a promising alternative to traditional silicon-based solar cells.</p></p>
