<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Prunes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pitted Prunes</li><li>Prunes with Pits</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Prunes come in two main market types - pitted prunes and prunes with pits. Pitted prunes have had the pits removed before packaging, making them convenient for immediate consumption or cooking. Prunes with pits still have the stone inside, requiring consumers to remove it themselves before eating. Both types offer unique advantages: pitted prunes are easier to eat, while prunes with pits may have a longer shelf life and potentially richer flavor due to the stone being left in during the drying process.</p></p>
