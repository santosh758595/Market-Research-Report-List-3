<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Current Sense Resistor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SMD Type</li><li>Through Hole Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Current Sense Resistor market can be categorized into two main types: SMD Type and Through Hole Type. SMD (Surface Mount Device) Type resistors are smaller in size and are mounted directly onto the surface of a printed circuit board. They are ideal for high density PCB designs. On the other hand, Through Hole Type resistors have leads that are inserted through holes in the PCB for secure mounting. They are more commonly used in applications where high power dissipation is required. Both types offer different advantages and are chosen based on specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
