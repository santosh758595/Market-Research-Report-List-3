<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-foldable Intraocular Lens Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hard Plastic</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-foldable intraocular lenses are of two main types: hard plastic and others. Hard plastic intraocular lenses are rigid in nature and typically require a larger incision during surgery for implantation. On the other hand, the "others" category includes lenses made of materials such as silicone, acrylic, polymethyl methacrylate, and hydrogel. These lenses are often more flexible and can be folded for easier insertion into the eye during surgery. Each type has its own advantages and considerations for patient outcomes.</p></p>
