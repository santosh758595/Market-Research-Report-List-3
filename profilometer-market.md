<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Profilometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Profilometer</li><li>Non-contact Profilometer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Profliometer market is categorized into two main types, contact and non-contact profilometers. Contact profilometers utilize a physical probe to directly measure surface features such as roughness, waviness, and step heights. Non-contact profilometers, on the other hand, use optical, laser, or stylus technologies to measure surface topography without physically touching the surface. Both types of profilometers are widely used in industries such as manufacturing, automotive, and electronics for precise surface measurement and quality control purposes.</p></p>
