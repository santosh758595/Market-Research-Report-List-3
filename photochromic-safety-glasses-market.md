<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photochromic Safety Glasses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Substrate Siscoloration Lens Glasses</li><li>Film-Changing Lens Glasses</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photochromic safety glasses come in two main types - substrate discoloration lens glasses and film-changing lens glasses. Substrate discoloration lens glasses contain photochromic chemicals that react to UV light and cause the lens to darken. Film-changing lens glasses, on the other hand, have a special film that darkens in response to UV light. Both types of glasses are designed to provide protection against harmful UV rays and offer convenience by automatically adjusting to changing light conditions.</p></p>
