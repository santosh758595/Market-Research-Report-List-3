<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Apheresis Collection Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugation</li><li>Membrane Filtration</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Apheresis collection systems are used to collect specific blood components from a donor or patient. There are two main types of apheresis collection systems: centrifugation and membrane filtration. </p><p>Centrifugation involves spinning the blood sample at high speeds, which separates the different blood components based on their density. The desired component is then collected and the rest of the blood is returned to the donor or patient.</p><p>Membrane filtration uses a porous membrane to selectively filter out the desired blood component while allowing other components to pass through. This method is particularly useful for collecting plasma or platelets.</p><p>Both types of collection systems are important in medical procedures such as blood transfusions and therapeutic treatments.</p></p>
