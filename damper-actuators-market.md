<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Damper Actuators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Spring Return Damper Actuators</li><li>Spring Return Damper Actuators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Damper actuators are devices used to control the opening and closing of dampers in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. There are two main types: non-spring return damper actuators and spring return damper actuators. Non-spring return actuators use electric motors to control the positioning of the damper, providing accurate and reliable operation. Spring return actuators, on the other hand, use a spring mechanism to close the damper in case of power failure, ensuring safety and preventing unwanted air flow. Both types are essential for efficient HVAC system control.</p></p>
