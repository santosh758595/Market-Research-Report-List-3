<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrocarbon Solvents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aliphatic Type</li><li>Aromatic Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydrocarbon solvents can be classified into two main types: aliphatic and aromatic. Aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents are derived from straight or branched chain hydrocarbons and are known for their low odor and color. They are commonly used in applications requiring a clear and odorless solvent. Aromatic hydrocarbon solvents, on the other hand, are derived from aromatic hydrocarbons and are known for their strong odor and superior solvency power. They are often used in applications where strong solvency is needed, such as in paints, coatings, and adhesives.</p></p>
